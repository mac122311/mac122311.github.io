         <p><strong>Dining</strong> We are more than just jokes at Mac's Dream Adventures, we are where
		fun and fantasies come to life for everyone. Our menu offers something for everyone. Slow Roasted Prime Rib, Hand Cut Fresh 
	    Salmon, Chicken, Pork and Fresh Seafood Dishes. You can even order our Specialty 
	    of the House, the Roman Orgy. A conglomerate Roast Feast with fresh fruit, 
	    vegetables, and other fare brought out with great fanfare and song. At Mac's Dream Adventures, 
		we feel that the food should be as special as the occasion.</a>.
